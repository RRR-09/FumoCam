# PythonNET on 3.9
Delete this folder if you were able to successfully install PythonNet.

For whatever reason, PythonNET can fail to build locally and there is no current wheel available as of 2021-05-15. This can be remedied by installing a pre-built wheel.

Attached is the Windows 64-bit v2.5.2 for Python3.9. It was hard to come by. Run "pip install pythonnet-2.5.2-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl".
